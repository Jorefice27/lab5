In this lab we wrote four different scheduling algorithms, first come
first served, shortest remaining time, round robin, and round robin with
priority. First come first served was definitely the easiest to write,
but clearly would not be a good implementation for an operating system
scheduler. Shortest time remaining was also fairly simple to implement,
and had the shortest average time from arrival to finish, however once again,
if this were to be implemented on a real operating system any long processes
would take even longer to complete since they would consistently have to
forfeit their CPU time for the countless shorter processes running. Round robin,
although being slightly harder to implement and resulting in a the longest
average time from arrival to finish, does give all processes a fairly equal
chance at CPU time. Finally, round robin with priority sees improved performance
over normal round robin. Additionally, it allows processes with higher priority
to finish ahead of processes with lower priority, but still divides CPU time even
within priority levels. This was challenging to implement cleanly with a single array,
so I made a slight modification to the queue that I made for project two, which made
implementing this algorithm fairly straight forward. After implementing our own
scheduling algorithms, we looked at the source code for the scheduling algorithm
written by HP. This implemented a "goodness" measure to dictate which process to
schedule next in it's priority round robin system.
